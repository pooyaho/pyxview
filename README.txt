User interfaces (UI) are one of the most important parts of enterprise applications. They contain
vast amounts of the domain knowledge which usually would be locked within codes of UI frameworks
and technologies, and never have had the chance to be represented via proper models and means.

The aim of the XView (eXtensible View) is to provide abstract and technology-independent means of
describing and modeling of the user interface. Inspired by Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and
pattern-oriented software design and development, XView seeks for a generic conceptual model for
UI and a set of principles, patterns, tools, and technologies for extensible, yet descriptive ways
for realizing UI.
